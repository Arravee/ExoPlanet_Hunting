# ExoPlanet_Hunting

## Jupyter Notebook
Please note that this notebook was run in Google Ccolab Pro. If you are running this on your home machine without GPU workload enabled for tensorflow you will experience significantly longer runtimes for the construction of the models. 

## Dataset
The notbook uses data from the K2 mission. Due to github's file size restriction the zip folder cannot be uploaded here directly. Instead please find the data here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1phICzaChdgbM3WSI47P-fuP9Q6ONqGSy/view?usp=sharing

## Presentation
A pdf version of the powerpoint presentation is also in the directory.
